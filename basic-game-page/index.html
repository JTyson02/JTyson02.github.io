                 <blockquote>
                    "Itâ€™s one of those games where you can really talk about what happened after you finished playing it. You can talk about what went wrong, what went right, why someone decided to build a Russian aircraft carrier, 
                    all the bad luck one player had, all the good luck another player had, how one particular move paralleled real events remarkably closely and 
                    how another move would be completely ridiculous if it happened in real life. Games are all about being social and any game that can lead to a good natter is a good game in my book."
