        <h1>Design notes</h1>
            <p>Well, the design process for this wasn't too detailed. My portfolio's goal is to show off my skills in designing games, though it pulls
                double duty in helping show off my HTML skills. My audience is anyone who would hire me, to be completely honest. I've included pretty much
                everything I wanted to, except for actual project examples to implement. My organization is straightforward: flexbox and divs. I probably should 
                have done a grid layout, but at this point it would take too much time to restructure everything. The reason I think I should have used 
                grid is because I had trouble getting the text to properly resize, and I could have done some more interesting layouts. Still, I 
                like the simplicity of the current design. I think it fits my personality well.
            </p>

        <h2>Image sources</h2>
            <p>All of my images are sourced from placeholder.com (exept for my homecoming picture obviously), and the video I used is
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEzD-Y97ges&ab_channel=ChuckScoggins">from here.</a>
            </p>

        <h2>Other Design notes:</h2>
            <p>All images will need to be 300px x 300px, video should be 300px tall as well. No special notes for updates, just swap out the 
                placeholder urls in the media tags and replace with custom content. I plan on adding actual projects before the final completed portfolio, 
                and maybe I'll have time over one of these breaks to pump out a personal project to fill in a blank space.
