                    This was based off of a previous project where we had to use autonomous agents to simulate a zombie outbreak utilizing steering forces.
                     We were then tasked with adding interactivity to make a game experience. I decided to go with a timeless classic: tag. The player starts off being 
                     hunted by an autonomous agent. The player is faster than the agent, but is slower to turn. Paired with a small game arena and multiple obstacles to 
                     weave in and out through, this combines into an interesting experience. Once the seeker agent touches the player, the player becomes "it," and must then 
                     hunt down another agent who spawns in the arena, this one fleeing the player. This was coded inside the Unity engine with C#. It also, as stated, utilizes 
                     autonomous agents, which are very basic AI. They require no human input to move in response to any outside stimulus.

                    This is a Browser DOM Text-Based RPG. It was created using HTML5 and JavaScript. The buttons fire off JavaScript OnClick functions that activate the 
                    various interactions in the game. The player's character can be saved locally, allowing for them to continue with the same character should they exit 
                    the webpage. The player starts out in a town where they can visit the local tavern and general store, the tavern allowing them to rest and heal, 
                    and the general store allowing them to sell goods and upgrade their stats. They can explore the wilderness nearby to find gold and sellable goods, but must 
                    fight their way through enemies first. The battle system is a simple auto-battle format.

                    This is a 3D render of a <a href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/rRlqWG" target="_blank">Butterfly Knife designed by Grzegorz Kozlowski</a>. This was designed to be a recreation in an attempt to further my progress in the craft. 
                    The 3D model was created in Maya and textured in Adobe Substance Painter. The mdoel was created by dividing up a single cylinder and extruding parts until it fit 
                    the shape needed. The hardest part of this project was overcoming the rounded blade guard, as well as the teething on the back. However, proper use of the extrusion tool, rotation, and insertion of edge loops allowed me to get close to 
                    the original.
