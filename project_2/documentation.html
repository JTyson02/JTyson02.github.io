    <p>I started this project trying to improve the original GIF finder project, but ran into some issues. I tried to make the GIPHY result recursive
        to filter the ratings chosen by the user, but that ended up not working. The day before the prototypes were due I knew I wouldn't be able to 
        finish that, so I swapped over to the Dog API. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do with it for a while, and just tried messing around with the 
        API until inspiration struck me. It didn't really, so I just ended up recreating a similar thing to the GIF finder. Except with dogs. So maybe
         better. There were some minor hiccups along the way, but I wasnt entirely sure how to handle them. There are specific dog breeds that when 
         selected always return an error. I have two theories about this, but I was never able to find a solution. My first theory was that there weren't 
         enough photos of the dogs stored on the API for there to be the correct number selected in the dropdown, but I disproved that by adding a '1'
         option. The second theory is a bit more complex. There's a "master breed" and "sub breeds" of specific dog types in the categories, but I don't
         know how they've set up the "master breeds." These dogs return an error saying that they're invalid "master breeds," and I was unable to find a 
        proper fix for this. I'll also say that I know I didn't add a third control, but I was simply unable to think up a useable one. The only two sources
        I used for this are the Dog API, and Coolors, a website to generate color palletes. Overall I'd give myself somewhere around an 80%. I didn't complete 
        some of the requirements, and there are some aspects of the site that I wouldn't call aesthetically pleasing, but overall its not the worst thing 
        I've ever made.
